## ðŸ“˜ OOPs Concepts

Understanding **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is the foundation of strong LLD skills. Make sure youâ€™re confident with the four pillars:

- **Abstraction** â€“ Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.  
- **Encapsulation** â€“ Bundling data and methods together while restricting direct access to internal data.  
- **Inheritance** â€“ Reusing properties and behaviors of one class in another to avoid duplication.  
- **Polymorphism** â€“ Using a single interface to represent different underlying forms or behaviors.

## ðŸ“˜ Design Principles

Design principles are the fundamental rules that help you write **clean, scalable, and maintainable** object-oriented code. They guide how classes should interact and how responsibilities should be divided.

- **SOLID** â€“ Single Responsibility, Open to Extension & Closed to Modification, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion  
- **DRY** â€“ Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself  
- **KISS** â€“ Keep It Simple, Stupid  
- **YAGNI** â€“ You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It  
- **GRASP** â€“ General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns

## ðŸ“˜ UML Class & Sequence Diagrams

UML (**Unified Modeling Language**) is a visual way to represent how your classes interact and relate in an object-oriented system. Itâ€™s crucial in LLD interviews because it shows how well you can design before writing code.

### ðŸ”‘ Base UML Concepts

Before drawing UML diagrams, understand these relationships:

| Concept | Meaning | Example |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Generalization** | "Is-A" relationship (Inheritance) | `Dog` â†’ `Animal` |
| **Association** | "Has-A" relationship | `Library` â†’ `Book` |
| **Aggregation** | Whole-part (independent) | `Department` â†’ `Professor` (professor can exist without department) |
| **Composition** | Whole-part (dependent) | `House` â†’ `Room` (room cannot exist without house) |
| **Dependency** | One class uses another temporarily | `PaymentService` â†’ `Logger` |
| **Multiplicity** | How many instances relate | `1..*`, `0..1` |
